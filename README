This is a prototype implementation of a path bar
================================================

This widget has been developed for my code editor (which I call Progress -- and
which is not released as public code yet).

Things it does ([+]) and it doesn't do ([-]):
 + easily add path elements to the path bar
 + path elements can have a shape
 - path element's shape is not specified by the theme yet
 - the whole widget set isn't themed yet
 - there is not accessibility (A11Y) support
 - some things aren't implemented yet (e.g. removal of widgets)


NOTE: This is prototype code and patches are welcome. However, this code has been
      included into my Progress source tree and fixes implemented there won't be
      backported to this repository.

NOTE: This code should be forked for your projects, but please respect the license
      (LGPLv2.1+) and the copyright (100% my code)
